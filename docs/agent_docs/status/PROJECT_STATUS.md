# 🏗️ The Forge: Project Status Report

**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Version:** 3.0.0 (Cloud Edition)
**Status:** Stable / Feature Complete

## 1. Project Overview

**The Forge** is an autonomous AI coding agent designed to democratize advanced coding capabilities. It leverages the **Gemini 2.0 Flash** model (free tier) to provide a commercial-grade coding experience similar to Claude Code, but without the associated costs. The system is built on a **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** architecture, allowing it to plan, execute, and iterate on tasks autonomously.

## 2. Core Architecture

### 2.1 Agent Engine
- **Model**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (via OpenRouter or Direct API)
- **Pattern**: ReAct Loop (Think -> Act -> Observe)
- **Context Window**: 10 Million Tokens (supports massive codebases)
- **Memory**: SQLite-based short-term memory + Vector-based long-term retrieval (RAG)

### 2.2 File System Isolation
- **User Space**: Clean workspace, only user files are visible.
- **System Space**: All system configurations, databases, logs, and chrome profiles are isolated in the `.forge/` hidden directory.
- **Git Integration**: `.forge/` is automatically added to `.gitignore` to prevent system file pollution.

### 2.3 Knowledge Management (The Garden)
- **Auto-Wiki**: Automatically digests conversations into structured Markdown documentation in `docs/`.
- **Categories**:
  - `architecture`: System design and structural decisions.
  - `features`: Functional specifications and requirements.
  - `issues`: Bug reports and troubleshooting logs.
  - `decisions`: Architectural Decision Records (ADR).
- **Query Archiving**: All user queries are time-stamped and archived in `docs/history/queries.md` for historical context.

## 3. Implemented Features

### ✅ Completed
| Feature | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent Core** | Autonomous planning and execution engine | **Stable** |
| **Tool System** | File I/O, Shell execution, MCP Bridge | **Stable** |
| **REPL Interface** | Interactive CLI with `@` commands | **Stable** |
| **Multi-Provider** | Support for Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI | **Stable** |
| **Grok Web Auto** | Puppeteer-based automation for Grok web interface | **New** |
| **Query Archive** | Automatic logging of user queries to `docs/history/` | **New** |
| **Hidden Config** | `.forge/` directory structure implementation | **Stable** |

### 🚧 In Progress / Planned
- **Visual Debugger**: GUI for visualizing the agent's thought process.
- **IDE Extension**: VS Code extension wrapping the CLI.

## 4. Technical Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (Node.js)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Database**: SQLite (better-sqlite3) with WAL mode
- **Browser Automation**: Puppeteer Core + Chrome Launcher
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for tool inputs

## 5. Recent Updates (Session Log)

### Grok Web Automation
Implemented `GrokWebStrategy` in `src/providers/strategies/grok-web.ts`. This allows the agent to interact with the Grok web interface directly, bypassing API limitations. It uses a local Chrome instance to maintain login state and Puppeteer for interaction.

### Query Archiving
Updated `KnowledgeManager` and `ForgeRepl` to intercept and log every user query. This ensures that no context is lost over time, creating a permanent record of the project's evolution in `docs/history/queries.md`.

## 6. Verification

- **Build Status**: ✅ Passed (`pnpm run build`)
- **Type Check**: ✅ Passed (No TypeScript errors)
- **Integration**: ✅ Verified (REPL connects to KnowledgeManager)
